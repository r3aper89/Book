"From the weakness of the mind, Omnissiah save us
From the lies of the Antipath, circuit perserve us
From the rage of the Beast, iron protect us
From the temptations of the Flesh, silica cleanse us
From the ravages of the Destroyer, anima shield us
From this rotting cage of biomatter, Machine God set us free."
â€”Chants of the Journeyman Verse III/w
